The continent is surrounded on all sides by a vast, deep blue ocean. The map should feel expansive and ancient.\n\n**Ocean:**\n*   **Color:** Deep, rich blue (#003366) for the main ocean, fading slightly to a lighter blue (#006699) near coastlines.\n*   **Texture:** Subtle, repeating wave patterns, very small and pixelated, indicating water movement.\n\n**Continent - General Terrain:**\n*   **Coastlines:** Irregular, jagged, and varied, with small coves and peninsulas. Sandy beaches (light tan #E0C69F) should be visible in some coastal areas, especially near Eastport.\n*   **Elevation:** Gradual elevation changes, with higher ground indicated by slightly darker green or brown hues.\n\n**Major River (Silverflow):**\n*   **Placement:** Originates in the northern third of the continent, flowing directly south through the exact horizontal center of the map, emptying into the ocean at the southern edge of the continent.\n*   **Width:** Approximately 8-12 pixels wide (500-750 meters), clearly visible.\n*   **Color:** Light blue (#66CCFF), distinct from the ocean.\n*   **Texture:** Smooth, flowing water, with subtle pixelated current lines.\n\n**Mountain Range (Western Edge):**\n*   **Placement:** Runs along the entire western edge of the continent, from the northernmost point to the southernmost point.\n*   **Appearance:** Jagged, towering peaks.\n*   **Color:** Dark grey (#444444) for rock faces, with prominent snow caps (pure white #FFFFFF) on the highest peaks, especially in the northern half of the range.\n*   **Texture:** Rough, rocky, with sharp angles and shadows indicating elevation.\n\n**Dense Forests (Northern Third):**\n*   **Placement:** Covers the entire northern third of the continent, extending from the western mountains to the eastern coast, and south to roughly one-third down the map.\n*   **Color:** Dark, deep green (#004D00) for coniferous trees, with some patches of slightly lighter green (#006600) for deciduous.\n*   **Texture:** Densely packed, individual tree canopy pixels, creating a thick, unbroken forest canopy.\n\n**Fertile Plains (Southern Regions):**\n*   **Placement:** Covers the entire southern half of the continent, south of the northern forests and east of the western mountains.\n*   **Color:** Vibrant, light green (#66CC66) with patches of slightly darker green (#339933) to indicate varied vegetation.\n*   **Texture:** Smooth, rolling, with subtle pixelated patterns suggesting fields and grasslands.\n\n**Coastal Areas (Eastern Shore):**\n*   **Placement:** A strip of varied terrain along the entire eastern edge of the continent, between the northern forests/southern plains and the ocean.\n*   **Appearance:** Mix of sandy beaches (light tan #E0C69F), rocky outcrops (light grey #AAAAAA), and sparse vegetation (light green #99CC99).\n\n**Small Islands (Off Eastern Coast):**\n*   **Placement:** A cluster of 3-5 small, irregularly shaped islands located approximately 100-200 pixels (6.25-12.5 km) off the eastern coast, roughly in the middle third of the map vertically.\n*   **Appearance:** Small landmasses with sandy shores and sparse green vegetation.\n\n**Settlements (Represented by small, distinct pixel clusters):**\n\n*   **Thornhaven (Capital):**\n    *   **Placement:** Exactly at the horizontal center of the map, on the eastern bank of the Silverflow River.\n    *   **Appearance:** A large, complex cluster of grey (#888888) and brown (#8B4513) pixels, representing buildings and walls. A small, distinct cluster of red pixels (#FF0000) in the center to denote its capital status. Approximately 20x20 pixels in size.\n\n*   **Eastport:**\n    *   **Placement:** On the eastern coast, roughly one-quarter of the way down from the top of the map.\n    *   **Appearance:** A medium-sized cluster of light brown (#D2B48C) and grey (#AAAAAA) pixels, indicating a coastal town. A small pier (dark brown #5A2D00) extending into the ocean. Approximately 10x10 pixels in size.\n\n*   **Millbrook:**\n    *   **Placement:** In the southern plains, approximately one-quarter of the way up from the bottom of the map, and one-quarter of the way in from the eastern coast.\n    *   **Appearance:** A small cluster of light brown (#D2B48C) and green (#99CC99) pixels, indicating an agricultural village. Approximately 5x5 pixels in size.\n\n*   **Ironpeak:**\n    *   **Placement:** Deep within the western mountain range, roughly in the middle third of the map vertically.\n    *   **Appearance:** A small cluster of dark grey (#666666) and brown (#8B4513) pixels, nestled amongst the mountain peaks. A small, distinct cluster of orange pixels (#FFA500) to indicate mining activity. Approximately 7x7 pixels in size.\n\n*   **Woodhaven:**\n    *   **Placement:** In the northern dense forests, approximately one-quarter of the way down from the top of the map, and one-quarter of the way in from the eastern edge of the forest.\n    *   **Appearance:** A small cluster of dark green (#006600) and brown (#8B4513) pixels, blending into the forest. Approximately 5x5 pixels in size.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Ancient, untamed, and slightly mysterious. The pixel art should be clean and distinct, with clear separation between terrain types. The overall impression should be of a vast, explorable world.\n```"}
