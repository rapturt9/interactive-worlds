{"result": "```\npixel art world map, top-down view, 1024x1024 pixels, 62.5 meters per pixel, vibrant fantasy style.\n\nThe map depicts a single, large, roughly rectangular continent, Eldermyst, filling approximately 80% of the canvas, centered. The remaining 20% is ocean, surrounding the continent on all sides, with a slightly wider ocean expanse on the eastern and western edges.\n\n**Ocean:** Deep, rich blue (#003366) with subtle lighter blue (#006699) pixel variations for depth and movement.\n\n**Continent Outline:** The continent's western edge is a jagged, imposing line of mountains. The northern edge is slightly rounded, transitioning into dense forest. The eastern edge is a mix of gentle curves and small inlets, leading to coastal areas. The southern edge is relatively straight, defining the fertile plains.\n\n**Mountains (Western Edge):** A prominent, continuous mountain range runs along the entire western edge of the continent, from north to south. These mountains are depicted in dark grey (#666666) and charcoal (#333333) pixels, with distinct, jagged peaks. The highest peaks, especially in the northern half of the range, are capped with bright white (#FFFFFF) snow pixels, gradually fading into the grey mountain texture. This range should be approximately 100-150 pixels wide at its base.\n\n**Forests (Northern Third):** The entire northern third of the continent, extending south from the northern coastline and east from the western mountain range, is covered in dense forest. This forest is a deep, dark green (#004D00) with variations of slightly lighter green (#006600) and occasional darker patches (#003300) to indicate density. The forest edge should be irregular and natural-looking, not a straight line.\n\n**Silverflow River:** A wide, prominent river, the Silverflow, originates in the northern mountains (within the forest region) and flows directly south, bisecting the continent roughly through its center, emptying into the southern ocean. The river is a lighter, flowing blue (#66CCFF) than the ocean, approximately 10-15 pixels wide, with subtle pixel variations to suggest current. It should be clearly visible as a major geographical feature.\n\n**Plains (Southern Regions):** The entire southern third of the continent, south of the forest and east of the mountains, is fertile plains. These plains are a vibrant, light green (#99CC66) with subtle variations of slightly darker green (#77B347) and occasional patches of light brown (#CCAA88) to suggest cultivated fields or dry patches.\n\n**Coastal Areas (Eastern Shore):** Along the entire eastern coastline of the continent, there are narrow strips of sandy beaches. These beaches are a light, warm tan (#FFCC99) and are approximately 5-10 pixels wide.\n\n**Islands (Eastern Coast):** Off the eastern coast, approximately 50-100 pixels from the mainland, there are 3-5 small, irregularly shaped islands. These islands are mostly green (#99CC66) with small patches of forest (#004D00) and tiny sandy beaches (#FFCC99).\n\n**Settlements:**\n*   **Thornhaven (Capital):** Located precisely at the geographical center of the continent, on the western bank of the Silverflow River. Depicted as a large cluster of grey (#AAAAAA) and red-roofed (#CC3333) buildings, enclosed by a thick, dark grey (#666666) pixel wall. It should be the largest settlement, approximately 40x40 pixels.\n*   **Eastport:** Located on the eastern coastline, roughly halfway between the northern and southern continental edges. Depicted as a medium-sized cluster of white (#FFFFFF) and blue-roofed (#336699) buildings, with a small dock extending into the ocean. Approximately 25x25 pixels.\n*   **Millbrook:** Located in the southern plains, approximately 150 pixels south-east of Thornhaven. Depicted as a small cluster of brown (#996633) and green-roofed (#669933) farmhouses, surrounded by small patches of lighter green fields. Approximately 15x15 pixels.\n*   **Ironpeak:** Located deep within the western mountain range, approximately 200 pixels north of the southern continental edge. Depicted as a small cluster of dark grey (#444444) buildings nestled amongst the mountain pixels, with a visible mine entrance (a small black pixel opening). Approximately 10x10 pixels.\n*   **Woodhaven:** Located in the northern forest region, approximately 100 pixels south of the northern coastline and 150 pixels east of the western mountain range. Depicted as a small cluster of wooden-looking brown (#8B4513) buildings, partially obscured by forest pixels. Approximately 10x10 pixels.\n\n**Roads:** Main roads connect all major settlements. These roads are thin, light brown (#A0522D) pixel lines, clearly visible against the terrain.\n*   A main road connects Thornhaven to Eastport.\n*   A main road connects Thornhaven to Millbrook.\n*   A main road connects Thornhaven to Ironpeak, winding through the mountains.\n*   A main road connects Thornhaven to Woodhaven, passing through the forest.\n*   A secondary road connects Eastport to Millbrook along the eastern plains.\n\n**Atmosphere:** A sense of ancient, untamed wilderness with pockets of civilization. The colors should be rich and slightly muted, evoking a classic fantasy feel. The pixel art should be clean and distinct, with clear boundaries between terrain types. No text labels on the map itself. The overall impression should be a detailed, functional, and aesthetically pleasing world map for the realm of Eldermyst.\n```"}
