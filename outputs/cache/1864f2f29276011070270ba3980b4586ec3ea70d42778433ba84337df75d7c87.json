{"result": "```\npixel art world map, 1024x1024 pixels, top-down orthogonal view, 16-bit SNES style, vibrant saturated colors, high contrast, clean crisp pixels, careful dithering for textures, consistent lighting from top-left.\n\nThe map depicts the continent of Eldermyst, filling the entire 1024x1024 canvas. The scale is 1 pixel = 62.5 meters, meaning the map covers 64km x 64km.\n\n**Ocean:** The entire outer perimeter of the map is a deep, rich blue ocean, extending inwards from all four edges. The ocean should have subtle wave patterns and variations in blue hues, becoming slightly lighter near the coastlines. The border between land and ocean is a distinct, slightly darker blue line.\n\n**Continent Shape:** A large, irregularly shaped temperate continent occupies the majority of the central canvas, surrounded by the ocean. Its western edge is relatively straight, while the eastern edge is more jagged with bays and peninsulas. The northern and southern edges of the continent are roughly horizontal.\n\n**Major River (Silverflow):** A prominent, winding river, the Silverflow, flows from the northern edge of the map, roughly 450 pixels from the western edge, southward through the center of the continent. It widens slightly as it progresses south, eventually emptying into the ocean at the southern edge of the map, approximately 500 pixels from the western edge. The river is a bright, flowing light blue, with a distinct, slightly darker blue border separating it from the surrounding land.\n\n**Mountain Range (Western Edge):** Along the entire western edge of the continent, a rugged mountain range rises. These mountains are depicted with jagged, dark grey and brown pixel art, with snow-capped peaks at their highest elevations (white pixels). The snow caps are most prominent in the northern half of the range. The mountain range is approximately 100-150 pixels wide from west to east. The border between mountains and adjacent terrain (forests to the east, plains to the southeast) is a distinct dark grey line.\n\n**Dense Forests (Northern Third):** The entire northern third of the continent, east of the mountain range and north of approximately the 350-pixel mark from the top, is covered in dense, dark green forests. These forests are depicted with varied shades of deep green, with individual tree clusters visible as darker pixel groupings. The border between the forest and the Silverflow River is a distinct dark green line. The border between the forest and the plains to the south is a distinct medium green line.\n\n**Fertile Plains (Southern Regions):** The southern half of the continent, south of approximately the 350-pixel mark from the top, and east of the mountain range, consists of fertile plains. These plains are depicted with vibrant, light green and yellow-green pixel art, suggesting lush grasslands and agricultural areas. Subtle variations in color can indicate fields or rolling hills. The border between the plains and the Silverflow River is a distinct light green line.\n\n**Coastal Areas (Eastern Shore):** Along the entire eastern shore of the continent, a narrow strip of lighter green and sandy yellow pixels represents coastal areas. These areas are approximately 20-50 pixels wide, indicating beaches and coastal vegetation. The border between the coastal areas and the ocean is a distinct sandy yellow line. The border between the coastal areas and the plains or forests inland is a distinct light green line.\n\n**Small Islands (Eastern Coast):** Off the eastern coast, approximately 100-200 pixels from the mainland, a cluster of 3-5 small, irregularly shaped islands are scattered. These islands are roughly 50-100 pixels in diameter, covered in light green and sandy pixels, similar to the coastal areas. The border between the islands and the ocean is a distinct sandy yellow line.\n\n**Major Settlements (Represented by distinct pixel art structures):**\n\n*   **Thornhaven (Capital):** Located centrally on the Silverflow River, approximately 500 pixels from the top and 500 pixels from the left. It is a large, walled city, depicted as a cluster of brown and grey pixel art buildings enclosed by a light grey pixel wall. The city is roughly 80x80 pixels in size. The border between the city and the river/surrounding plains is a distinct light grey line.\n\n*   **Eastport:** Located on the eastern shore, approximately 400 pixels from the top and 850 pixels from the left. It is a coastal trading city, depicted as a cluster of brown and red-roofed pixel art buildings with a small pixel art dock extending into the ocean. The city is roughly 60x60 pixels in size. The border between the city and the ocean/coastal areas is a distinct red-brown line.\n\n*   **Millbrook:** Located in the southern plains, approximately 750 pixels from the top and 600 pixels from the left. It is an agricultural village, depicted as a small cluster of brown and green pixel art farmhouses with surrounding pixel art fields (lighter green/yellow patches). The village is roughly 40x40 pixels in size. The border between the village and the surrounding plains is a distinct light brown line.\n\n*   **Ironpeak:** Located within the western mountains, approximately 400 pixels from the top and 150 pixels from the left. It is a mining settlement, depicted as a small cluster of dark grey pixel art buildings with visible pixel art mine entrances (darker holes) in the mountain face. The settlement is roughly 30x30 pixels in size. The border between the settlement and the surrounding mountains is a distinct dark grey line.\n\n*   **Woodhaven:** Located deep within the northern forests, approximately 200 pixels from the top and 600 pixels from the left. It is a forest village, depicted as a small cluster of brown and dark green pixel art wooden huts, blending into the forest. The village is roughly 30x30 pixels in size. The border between the village and the surrounding forest is a distinct dark green line.\n\nNo text labels, names, or legends are present on the map. All features are clearly distinguishable and fill the entire canvas without being cut off at the edges.\n```"}
