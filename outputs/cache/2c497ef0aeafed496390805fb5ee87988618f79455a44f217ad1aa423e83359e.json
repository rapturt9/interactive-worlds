{"result": "A 1024x1024 pixel art world map, 16-bit SNES era style, top-down orthogonal view, with consistent top-left lighting. The map depicts a large, roughly rectangular continent filling the majority of the square canvas, surrounded on all sides by a vast, deep blue ocean. The ocean should have subtle wave patterns and a slightly darker blue border where it meets the land.\n\nThe continent is dominated by a massive, winding river, appearing as a bright, flowing blue ribbon, originating from the northern third of the continent and flowing directly south, bisecting the landmass before emptying into the southern ocean. This river should be approximately 10-15 pixels wide at its narrowest and widen slightly as it flows south.\n\nAlong the entire western edge of the continent, a prominent mountain range rises, characterized by jagged, dark grey and brown peaks with stark white, snow-capped summits. These mountains should be densely packed, forming a formidable barrier, and extend from the northern to the southern borders of the continent. The mountain range should be approximately 80-100 pixels wide.\n\nThe northern third of the continent, north of the central river's origin, is covered in dense, dark green forests, depicted with tightly clustered tree sprites. These forests should have a slightly darker green border where they meet other terrain types.\n\nThe southern half of the continent, south of the central river's origin, transitions into expansive, light green fertile plains, dotted with occasional lighter green patches representing fields. These plains should extend to the eastern and southern coasts.\n\nThe eastern edge of the continent features a long, sandy coastline, depicted with light yellow-brown pixels, gently curving along the ocean. Off this eastern coast, several small, irregularly shaped islands are scattered, ranging from 10x10 to 30x30 pixels in size, each with a sandy perimeter and a small patch of green vegetation in its center.\n\n**Major Settlements (represented by distinct pixel art structures, no text):**\n\n1.  **Central Walled City:** Located precisely at the geographical center of the continent, situated directly on the central river. This settlement should be a large, intricate cluster of grey and red-roofed buildings, enclosed by a thick, light grey pixel wall, approximately 60x60 pixels in size. The river should flow through or alongside it.\n\n2.  **Eastern Coastal Trading Town:** Positioned on the eastern coastline, roughly halfway between the northern and southern continental edges. This settlement should be a medium-sized cluster of white and blue-roofed buildings, with a small dock extending into the ocean, approximately 30x30 pixels.\n\n3.  **Southern Agricultural Village:** Located in the southern plains, approximately one-quarter of the way from the southern coast and one-third of the way from the eastern coast. This settlement should be a small cluster of brown-roofed farmhouses with surrounding green fields, approximately 15x15 pixels.\n\n4.  **Western Mining Settlement:** Nestled deep within the western mountain range, roughly halfway up the mountain range from the southern edge of the continent. This settlement should be a small cluster of dark grey and brown buildings, with visible mine entrances (small dark holes) in the mountain face nearby, approximately 20x20 pixels.\n\n5.  **Northern Forest Village:** Situated deep within the northern dense forests, approximately one-quarter of the way from the northern edge of the continent and one-third of the way from the western edge. This settlement should be a small cluster of wooden huts with green roofs, blending into the forest, approximately 15x15 pixels.\n\n**Terrain Colors and Borders:**\n\n*   **Ocean:** Deep blue (#000080) with a slightly darker blue border (#000040) where it meets land.\n*   **Mountains:** Dark grey (#404040) and brown (#8B4513) with stark white snow caps (#FFFFFF). Border with other terrain: dark grey (#202020).\n*   **Forests:** Dense dark green (#006400) with individual tree sprites. Border with other terrain: darker green (#003200).\n*   **Plains:** Light green (#90EE90) with patches of slightly lighter green (#ADFF2F). Border with other terrain: medium green (#6B8E23).\n*   **River:** Bright flowing blue (#00BFFF). Border with land: slightly darker blue (#0080FF).\n*   **Coastline/Islands:** Light yellow-brown sand (#F4A460). Border with ocean: slightly darker yellow-brown (#CD853F).\n\nThe map should convey a sense of a vibrant, ancient world, with clear distinctions between biomes and settlements, all rendered in crisp, high-contrast pixel art. No text labels or legends whatsoever."}
