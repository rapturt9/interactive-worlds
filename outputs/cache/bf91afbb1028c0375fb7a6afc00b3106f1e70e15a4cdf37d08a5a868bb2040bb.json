{"result": "```\nA top-down, pixel art world map of Eldermyst, 1024x1024 pixels, depicting a 64km x 64km area where 1 pixel equals 62.5 meters. The map is dominated by a large, temperate continent filling most of the canvas, surrounded by a deep blue ocean along all edges.\n\nThe northern third of the continent is covered by dense, dark green pixel art forests, transitioning into lighter green rolling hills in the central regions. A prominent, light blue pixel art Silverflow River, at least 3-4 pixels wide, originates in the northern forests, flows south through a central valley, and empties into the ocean in the southern plains.\n\nThe western side of the continent features a rugged, jagged pixel art mountain range, depicted in shades of grey and brown, with distinct white pixel art snow caps on the highest peaks. The southern regions are characterized by expansive, light green pixel art fertile plains, dotted with patches of yellow-green pixel art agricultural fields around settlements.\n\nAlong the eastern shore, a narrow strip of light tan pixel art beaches separates the land from the ocean. Several small, irregularly shaped pixel art islands, covered in light green vegetation, are scattered in the ocean off the eastern coast.\n\nMajor settlements are clearly marked with distinct pixel art icons:\n- **Thornhaven (Capital):** A large, intricate pixel art walled city icon, predominantly grey and brown, is centrally located on the Silverflow River.\n- **Eastport:** A medium-sized pixel art port city icon, with docks and ships, is positioned on the eastern coast.\n- **Millbrook:** A small pixel art village icon, with a few houses and fields, is placed within the southern fertile plains.\n- **Ironpeak:** A small pixel art mining town icon, with mine shafts and rocky terrain, is nestled within the western mountain range.\n- **Woodhaven:** A small pixel art village icon, surrounded by trees, is located within the northern dense forests.\n\nVisible pixel art roads, 1-2 pixels wide and light brown in color, connect Thornhaven to Eastport, Millbrook, Ironpeak, and Woodhaven, forming a clear network across the continent. The overall aesthetic is a classic, vibrant pixel art style, with clear distinctions between biomes and features. The entire 1024x1024 canvas is filled with this detailed world map, showing a complete overview of Eldermyst.\n```"}
