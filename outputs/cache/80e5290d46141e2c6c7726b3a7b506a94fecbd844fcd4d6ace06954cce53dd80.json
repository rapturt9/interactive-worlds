{"result": "A 1024x1024 pixel art world map, 16-bit SNES era style, top-down orthogonal view, vibrant saturated colors, consistent top-left lighting, no text labels. The map depicts a large temperate continent surrounded by ocean, filling the entire square canvas. Each pixel represents 62.5 meters.\n\nThe ocean, a deep, rich blue with subtle wave dithering, completely encircles the central landmass. The continent occupies approximately 80% of the map's width and height, centered.\n\nA prominent, wide river, the \"Silverflow,\" flows from the northern edge of the continent, slightly west of center, southward through the exact geographical center of the map, emptying into the ocean at the southern edge. The river is a lighter, flowing blue, clearly distinct from the ocean.\n\nAlong the entire western edge of the continent, a rugged mountain range rises. These mountains are depicted in dark grays and browns, with jagged peaks. The highest peaks, particularly in the northern half of this range, are capped with bright white snow, subtly dithered. The mountain range is approximately 100-150 pixels wide at its base.\n\nThe northern third of the continent, extending from the eastern edge of the mountain range to the eastern coast, is covered in dense forests. These forests are represented by a rich, dark green, with individual tree clusters visible as darker pixel groupings, creating a thick canopy effect. The forest border with other terrain types is a distinct, slightly darker green.\n\nThe southern regions of the continent, south of the dense forests and east of the mountains, are fertile plains. These plains are a vibrant, light green, with subtle variations in shade to suggest rolling terrain and scattered patches of lighter green for fields. The border between plains and forest is a distinct, slightly yellowish-green.\n\nAlong the eastern shore of the continent, a narrow strip of coastal land, approximately 50-70 pixels wide, is depicted in a sandy, light brown color, transitioning smoothly into the ocean. This coastal strip extends from the northern forest edge down to the southern plains.\n\nOff the eastern coast, approximately 100-200 pixels from the mainland, a cluster of small islands is scattered. These islands are varied in size, from 20x20 pixels to 50x50 pixels, and are covered in a mix of light green plains and small patches of dark green forest.\n\nFive major settlements are strategically placed:\n\n1.  **Central Walled City:** Located precisely at the geographical center of the map, on the banks of the main river. This is a large, intricate settlement, approximately 80x80 pixels, with prominent gray walls, red-roofed buildings, and a central keep. The river flows directly through or alongside it.\n\n2.  **Eastern Coastal Trading City:** Situated on the eastern coast, roughly halfway between the northern forest edge and the southern plains. This city is approximately 60x60 pixels, with docks extending into the ocean, light-colored buildings, and a bustling appearance.\n\n3.  **Southern Agricultural Village:** Located in the southern plains, approximately 200 pixels from the southern edge of the map and 300 pixels from the eastern edge. This is a smaller settlement, about 30x30 pixels, surrounded by distinct patches of cultivated fields (lighter green/yellowish pixels) and a few scattered farmhouses.\n\n4.  **Western Mining Settlement:** Nestled within the western mountain range, approximately 300 pixels from the western edge and 400 pixels from the northern edge. This settlement is about 40x40 pixels, characterized by darker, stone-like buildings, mine entrances (small dark holes), and visible paths winding through the mountains.\n\n5.  **Northern Forest Village:** Deep within the dense northern forests, approximately 200 pixels from the northern edge and 300 pixels from the eastern edge. This village is about 30x30 pixels, with wooden-looking buildings, blending into the forest canopy, and small clearings.\n\nAll terrain types have clear, distinct border colors:\n- Ocean to land: A thin, bright cyan line.\n- Forest to plains: A thin, slightly yellowish-green line.\n- Mountains to plains/forest: A thin, dark brown line.\n- River to land: A thin, light blue line.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of a vibrant, explorable fantasy world, with clear distinctions between biomes and settlements.
