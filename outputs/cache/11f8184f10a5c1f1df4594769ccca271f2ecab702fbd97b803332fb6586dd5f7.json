The continent is roughly centered, with ocean surrounding it on all sides, extending to the edges of the map.\n\n**Ocean:** Deep blue (#000080) with subtle lighter blue (#0000CD) wave patterns, especially near coastlines.\n\n**Continent Shape:** A large, irregular landmass, wider in the north and tapering slightly in the south.\n\n**Major River (Silverflow):** A prominent, winding river, 10-15 pixels wide, flowing from the northern edge of the map, roughly through the vertical center, southward to the southern coast. It should be a lighter blue (#4682B4) than the ocean.\n\n**Mountain Range (Western Edge):** A rugged, continuous mountain range, 50-80 pixels wide, running along the entire western edge of the continent, from north to south. Peaks are dark grey (#696969) with distinct white (#FFFFFF) snow caps on the highest points. The range should be clearly visible and imposing.\n\n**Forests (Northern Third):** The entire northern third of the continent, north of the approximate latitude of Thornhaven, is covered in dense, dark green (#006400) forest. Individual trees are not visible at this scale, but the texture should be a rich, varied green, indicating dense woodland. The forest extends to the western mountains and eastern coast.\n\n**Fertile Plains (Southern Regions):** The southern half of the continent, south of Thornhaven, is primarily fertile plains. These are depicted in a bright, vibrant green (#32CD32), with subtle variations in shade to suggest rolling terrain.\n\n**Coastal Areas (Eastern Shore):** The eastern coastline features narrow strips of light tan (#F5DEB3) sandy beaches, 5-10 pixels wide, bordering the ocean.\n\n**Small Islands (Eastern Coast):** Three to five small, irregularly shaped islands, 20-40 pixels in diameter, are scattered off the eastern coast, within 100-200 pixels of the mainland. They are green (#32CD32) with small sandy beaches (#F5DEB3).\n\n**Settlements (Represented by building clusters):**\n\n*   **Thornhaven (Capital):** Located precisely at the geographical center of the map (512, 512), situated directly on the Silverflow River. It's a large cluster of brown (#8B4513) and grey (#A9A9A9) buildings, approximately 40x40 pixels, surrounded by a distinct, thin grey (#808080) wall.\n*   **Eastport:** Located on the eastern coast, roughly 200 pixels east of Thornhaven's latitude. It's a medium-sized cluster of brown (#8B4513) buildings, approximately 25x25 pixels, directly adjacent to the sandy beach.\n*   **Millbrook:** Located in the southern plains, approximately 200 pixels south and 100 pixels west of Thornhaven. It's a small cluster of brown (#8B4513) buildings, approximately 15x15 pixels, surrounded by lighter green (#90EE90) agricultural fields.\n*   **Ironpeak:** Located deep within the western mountain range, approximately 150 pixels west and 50 pixels north of Thornhaven. It's a small cluster of dark grey (#696969) buildings, approximately 15x15 pixels, nestled amongst the mountain peaks.\n*   **Woodhaven:** Located in the northern forest, approximately 200 pixels north and 50 pixels east of Thornhaven. It's a small cluster of dark brown (#5C4033) buildings, approximately 15x15 pixels, blending into the dark green forest.\n\n**Main Roads:** Thin, light brown (#D2B48C) lines, 2-3 pixels wide, connecting the major settlements.\n*   A prominent road connects Thornhaven to Eastport.\n*   A prominent road connects Thornhaven to Millbrook.\n*   A prominent road connects Thornhaven to Ironpeak, winding through the mountains.\n*   A prominent road connects Thornhaven to Woodhaven, extending into the northern forest.\n*   A road also connects Eastport to Woodhaven along the eastern coast.\n\nThe entire map should be cohesive, with smooth transitions between terrain types, and all features clearly distinguishable at the 1 pixel = 62.5 meters scale. No text labels on the map.\n```"}
