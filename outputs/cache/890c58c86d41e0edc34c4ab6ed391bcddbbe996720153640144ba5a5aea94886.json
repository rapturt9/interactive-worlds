{"result": "A high-detail pixel art map tile, 1024x1024 pixels, depicting a 1km x 1km section of the Eldermyst world map. The entire tile is deep ocean, consistent with the parent map's dark blue water. The water should be textured with subtle pixel art waves and ripples, showing slight variations in shade to imply depth and movement. The edges of the tile should seamlessly blend with the surrounding ocean, maintaining the consistent dark blue color. No landmass, islands, or any other features should be present. The focus is entirely on the vast, open ocean at this zoomed-in scale. The style should be clean pixel art, matching the aesthetic of the provided parent map. No text labels or legends."}
