{"result": "```\npixel art world map, 1024x1024 pixels, top-down view, fantasy style.\n\nA vast, temperate continent dominates the entire 1024x1024 pixel canvas, filling approximately 85-90% of the total area. The remaining 10-15% is ocean, surrounding the continent on all sides, with a slightly wider expanse on the eastern edge. The continent's shape is roughly an irregular oval, stretching from the top edge to the bottom edge and from the left edge to the right edge, ensuring no significant empty space.\n\n**Ocean:** Deep, rich cerulean blue (#007BA7) with subtle, lighter blue (#66B2FF) pixel variations for gentle wave texture, especially near coastlines.\n\n**Continent Terrain Breakdown (from north to south, west to east):**\n\n*   **Western Mountains (The Spine of Eldermyst):** A prominent, jagged mountain range runs vertically along the western edge of the continent, occupying approximately 10-15% of the continent's width. These mountains are characterized by dark grey (#4A4A4A) and charcoal (#36454F) pixels for rock faces, with stark white (#FFFFFF) and light grey (#D3D3D3) pixels for snow-capped peaks, particularly in the northern half of the range. The peaks are highest and most numerous in the northwest, gradually tapering in height and density towards the south. This range starts near the top-left corner and extends almost to the bottom-left corner.\n\n*   **Northern Forests (The Whispering Woods):** Immediately east of the northern half of the western mountains, and extending across the entire northern third of the continent (roughly the top 300-350 pixels of the continent's height), lies a dense, ancient forest. This forest is depicted with a mosaic of deep emerald green (#006400), forest green (#228B22), and olive green (#6B8E23) pixels, creating a thick, unbroken canopy. Individual trees are not discernible at this scale (1 pixel = 62.5m), but the varied greens suggest dense foliage.\n\n*   **Central River (The Silverflow):** A wide, meandering river, the Silverflow, originates from the northern mountains (approximately 150 pixels from the top edge, 300 pixels from the left edge) and flows directly south, bisecting the continent. It is depicted as a ribbon of light blue (#ADD8E6) pixels, approximately 10-15 pixels wide (625m - 937.5m wide), maintaining a consistent width as it flows towards the southern ocean. Its path is generally straight but with gentle, natural curves.\n\n*   **Fertile Southern Plains (The Golden Fields):** South of the northern forests, and extending to the southern coast, are vast fertile plains. These plains are primarily a vibrant, light green (#90EE90) and meadow green (#7CFC00), with occasional patches of slightly darker green (#6B8E23) to suggest varied vegetation. This area covers the central and southern portions of the continent, east of the mountains and west of the eastern coast.\n\n*   **Eastern Coastal Areas (The Azure Coast):** Along the entire eastern edge of the continent, a strip of slightly lighter green (#A2CD5A) or sandy beige (#F5DEB3) pixels indicates coastal plains and beaches, approximately 20-30 pixels wide. This transitions smoothly into the ocean.\n\n*   **Small Eastern Islands (The Azure Isles):** Off the eastern coast, approximately 100-200 pixels from the eastern continental shoreline, a cluster of 3-5 small, irregularly shaped islands are scattered. These islands are primarily light green (#90EE90) with sandy edges (#F5DEB3), each island being roughly 30-60 pixels in diameter.\n\n**Major Settlements (represented by distinct pixel clusters):**\n\n*   **Thornhaven (Capital):** Located precisely at the geographical center of the continent, on the western bank of the Silverflow River. It is a large, intricate cluster of light grey (#C0C0C0) and brown (#8B4513) pixels, forming a roughly circular shape approximately 40x40 pixels (2.5km x 2.5km). A distinct, slightly darker grey (#808080) pixel outline suggests a wall. The Silverflow flows directly past its eastern edge.\n\n*   **Eastport:** Situated on the eastern coast, approximately 350 pixels from the top edge of the map, directly on the coastline. It is a medium-sized cluster of light brown (#D2B48C) and white (#F8F8F8) pixels, forming an irregular shape approximately 25x25 pixels (1.5km x 1.5km), with a clear connection to the ocean.\n\n*   **Millbrook:** Located in the southern plains, approximately 150 pixels from the bottom edge of the map and 200 pixels from the left edge (east of the mountains). It is a small, compact cluster of light brown (#D2B48C) and dark green (#3CB371) pixels, roughly 15x15 pixels (937.5m x 937.5m), blending into the surrounding fertile plains.\n\n*   **Ironpeak:** Nestled deep within the western mountain range, approximately 400 pixels from the top edge and 100 pixels from the left edge. It is a small, dense cluster of dark grey (#696969) and reddish-brown (#A52A2A) pixels, roughly 15x15 pixels (937.5m x 937.5m), appearing as a small scar or indentation within the mountain texture.\n\n*   **Woodhaven:** Located deep within the northern forests, approximately 200 pixels from the top edge and 400 pixels from the left edge. It is a small, organic cluster of dark green (#3CB371) and light brown (#D2B48C) pixels, roughly 15x15 pixels (937.5m x 937.5m), appearing as a slight clearing or lighter patch within the dense forest.\n\nThe entire map is rendered with a consistent pixel art aesthetic, ensuring crisp edges and a charming, retro feel. The colors are vibrant but natural, creating a cohesive and immersive fantasy world. No text labels or legends are present.\n```"}
