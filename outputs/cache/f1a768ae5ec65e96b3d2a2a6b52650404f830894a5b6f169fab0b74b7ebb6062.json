{"result": "pixel art map tile, 1024x1024 pixels, Eldermyst world, top-down view. This tile represents a 1.00km x 1.00km section of the ocean, located at (1000, 0) meters from the parent map's top-left. The entire canvas should be filled with deep blue ocean water, consistent with the style and color palette of the parent map and sibling tiles. The ocean should have subtle, pixelated wave patterns and variations in shade to indicate depth and movement, matching the detail level of the sibling tile (0,0). The edges of this tile must seamlessly blend with any adjacent ocean tiles. No landmasses, islands, or settlements are present. No text. Clear border colors between terrain types (though only one terrain type here)."}
